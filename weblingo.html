            <p class="ipsum_text">WebLingo is a translation tool specially built for people learning languages.
               Learn a language by navigating websites, and learn grammar, context, and quiz yourself for mastery.
               In addition, WebLingo also assists with learning web literacy for those less experience.

               WebLingo addresses needs brought up in requirement elicitations by accounting for diverse user wants.
               Because beginners may not be interested in context or free response, all features are toggleable for a flexible
               user experience. This extension is meant to cater to all degrees of language learning, by teaching cultural effects,
               as well as grammar, quizzing, and web navigation.
            </p>
            <div class="image_1"><img src="images/Figma Prototype.png" alt="A screenshot of the first figma prototype of WebLingo"></div>
            <p class="ipsum_text">
               <br>The three requirements we found through requirement solicitation are:
               <br> (1) Remembering - The user will have a history of previously translated words.
               <br> (2) Translation - The user can translate words from one language to another. 
               <br> (3) Quizzes - The user will be quizzed on web content.
               <br><br> The mid-fidelity prototype addresses all of these requirements with flexible 
               settings customizable to peoples' needs, including history, context, quizzes, and 
               grammar. These correspond to the requirements: history to history, translation through
               the answers given by context, grammar, and quizzes, and two different types of quizzes.
               <br><br> Each GIF corresponds to a requirement - the first shows an option to enable History as an option, as well as the other possible options such as quiz, history, context, web help, and grammar, 
               the second shows translation information, giving context and grammar clues as well as history, and the third
               demonstrates a type of quiz that can be solved, and how the quiz reacts to incorrect answers.
               <br><br> To generate these requirements, we first asked participants to brainstorm what features they would like from WebLingo, 
               then asked them how they would interact and use these features. In addition, we also asked them to imagine they were a student studying for a test,
               or a person with English as a second language. This was a fictional inquiry. We then asked them how they would approach this as that user. We then analyzed recorded sessions of these interviews
               to find the common ground between participants and find which features were most frequently demanded and what forms they would
               take. We did this with a qualitative analysis, coding each comment with what features we believed they were asking for, and grouping
               similar comments. After analysis was complete, we had three requirements. We then constructed user interfaces and asked users to think-aloud,
               describing their thought process as they engaged with the prototype. We then used these to make revisions for the UI to make it more clear
               for users on how to interact with the UI until it was clear.
