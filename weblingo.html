            <p class="ipsum_text">By: Ian Tarter, David Toledo, Chloe Xufeng, Emma Zhang</p>
            <p class="ipsum_text">WebLingo is a translation tool specially built for people learning languages.
               Learn a language by navigating websites, and learn grammar, context, and quiz yourself for mastery.
               In addition, WebLingo also assists with learning web literacy for those less experience.

               WebLingo addresses needs brought up in requirement elicitations by accounting for diverse user wants.
               Because beginners may not be interested in context or free response, all features are toggleable for a flexible
               user experience. This extension is meant to cater to all degrees of language learning, by teaching cultural effects,
               as well as grammar, quizzing, and web navigation.
            </p>
            <div class="image_1"><img src="images/Figma Prototype.png" alt="A screenshot of the first figma prototype of WebLingo"></div>
            <p class="ipsum_text">
               <br>The three requirements we found through requirement solicitation are:
               <br> (1) Remembering - The user will have a history of previously translated words.
               <br> (2) Translation - The user can translate words from one language to another. 
               <br> (3) Quizzes - The user will be quizzed on web content.
               <br><br> The mid-fidelity prototype addresses all of these requirements with flexible 
               settings customizable to peoples' needs, including history, context, quizzes, and 
               grammar. These correspond to the requirements: history to history, translation through
               the answers given by context, grammar, and quizzes, and two different types of quizzes.
               <br><br> Each GIF corresponds to a requirement - the first shows an option to enable History as an option, as well as the other possible options such as quiz, history, context, web help, and grammar, 
               the second shows translation information, giving context and grammar clues as well as history, and the third
               demonstrates a type of quiz that can be solved, and how the quiz reacts to incorrect answers.
               <br><br> To generate these requirements, we first asked participants to brainstorm what features they would like from WebLingo, 
               then asked them how they would interact and use these features. In addition, we also asked them to imagine they were a student studying for a test,
               or a person with English as a second language. This was a fictional inquiry. We then asked them how they would approach this as that user. We then analyzed recorded sessions of these interviews
               to find the common ground between participants and find which features were most frequently demanded and what forms they would
               take. We did this with a qualitative analysis, coding each comment with what features we believed they were asking for, and grouping
               similar comments. After analysis was complete, we had three requirements. We then constructed user interfaces and asked users to think-aloud,
               describing their thought process as they engaged with the prototype. We then used these to make revisions for the UI to make it more clear
               for users on how to interact with the UI until it was clear.

            <p class="ipsum_text" style="padding: 0 100px;">
               <br>After requirements generation, we conducted UX evaluation, in which we gave potential users our Figma prototypes and invited them to use it and think openly about their process. 
               This process was co-discovery, in which two people looked and evaluated the prototype and openly discussed their thoughts.
               We assigned various tasks to the participants using the website. Our tasks were take a quiz, change the default language, and modify settings.
               For each of these, we wanted to know how easy it was for the user to understand these.
               It seemed like grammar and context hints were clear and understandable, however, users had a bit of trouble understanding what History referred to and the popup leading to questions
               about the quiz were hard to find. In addition, the quizzes were easy to navigate, due to similarity to existing quizzes, but translation was unclear.
               Some anonymized quotes that back this up are:
               <br>"It just seems to me that you would be, like, switching the language of the site. 
               Having an arrow like that shows the language that you're translating from, and like a drop down menu to like what you're changing it to would be more obvious." <br>- This shows that translation would be more intuitive with inclusion of what you're translating from.
               <br><br>"When I click Submit, it tells me that my answer was wrong and it would me that my answer was wrong, and it would give me the correct answer" <br>This shows the users understood the quiz function.
               <br><br> "She can't interact with it. What is she supposed to do?" <br>This shows the users were confused about what features were and weren't interactive.
               <br><br> In addition, we also collected stats:
               <br>
               <br>Time spent on menus:
               <br>- Quizzes: 3 min
               <br>- Grammar: 1 min
               <br>- Context: 30 sec
               <br>- Settings: 20 sec
               <br>- Translation: 20 sec
               <br>- Percent of quizzes correct: 0
               <br>
               <br> For next steps, based on UX evaluation, I'd like to expand the data to more browsers
               beyond Google Chrome, and possibly mobile users as well. In addition, a more expansive 
               history would be appreciated, based on the prototypes of other teammates, that showed words commonly
               mistaken. Also, specifying which words would be highlighted would also be helpful, whether that be users
               choosing which words to highlight, or choosing words that are commonly mistaken.
